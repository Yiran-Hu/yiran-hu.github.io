Hi, my name is Yiran Hu.I am now a 6-th year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Texas at Austin. I am interested in Numerics and Analysis of partial differential equations. I am currently focusing on the 3D Quasi-geostrophic system. I am now working with Prof. [Alexis Vasseur](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/vasseur/). Here is my [CV](CV.pdf). Before I came here, I graduated from Nanjing University.

Research Interests
======
My research interest lies in Theoretical and Numerical Analysis of Partial Differential Equations. I am now interested in the 3D Quasi-Geostrophic System and Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equation.  I have strong interests in problems that involcing physical background. Also I am interested in elliptic theories involving spectrum analysis. I am now focusing on a singular(or degenerated) family of 3D Quasi-Geostrophic System and Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equation. For conferences and publications see my [CV](CV.pdf). 

I also have interests in programming and time series analysis. I was a summer intern at World Quant LLC in summer 2023 and have done projects related to auto-encoder, optimization method, C++ programming and finance.

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
