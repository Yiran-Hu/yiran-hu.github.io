Hi, I am Yiran Hu, a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Texas at Austin. My research is rooted in Theoretical and Numerical Analysis of Partial Differential Equations. Specifically, I have developed an interest in the 3D Quasi-geostrophic system and the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equation. I work under the mentorship of Professor [Alexis Vasseur](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/vasseur/). For a comprehensive overview of my academic journey, please see my [curriculum vitae](files/CV.pdf). Before I came here, I graduated from Nanjing University.

Research Interests
======
I investigate the intricate discipline of Partial Differential Equations, both in theory and numerical analysis. Currently, my primary research is concentrated on the 3D Quasi-Geostrophic System and Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equation, with problems with strong physical emphases. Additionally, I’m interested in elliptic theories, particularly those involving spectrum analysis. Presently, I explore a singular or degenerated family of the 3D Quasi-Geostrophic System and the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equation. For details of my contributions to academic conferences and publications, please see my [curriculum vitae](files/CV.pdf). 

In addition to my scholarly pursuits, I’m an enthusiastic learner of programming. My dedication to academic rigor and the pursuit of knowledge extends to my practical experience, as I completed a meaningful internship at World Quant LLC during the summer of 2023. I engaged in financial research projects that encompassed auto-encoder, time series analysis, optimization methodologies, data analysis and C++ programming.
