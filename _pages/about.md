Hi, my name is Yiran Hu.I am now a 6-th year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Texas at Austin. I am interested in Numerics and Analysis of partial differential equations. I am currently focusing on the 3D Quasi-geostrophic system. I am now working with Prof. [Alexis Vasseur](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/vasseur/). Here is my [CV](files/CV.pdf). Before I came here, I graduated from Nanjing University.

Research Interests
======
My research interest lies in Theoretical and Numerical Analysis of Partial Differential Equations. I am now interested in the 3D Quasi-Geostrophic System and Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equation.  I have strong interests in problems that involcing physical background. Also I am interested in elliptic theories involving spectrum analysis. I am now focusing on a singular(or degenerated) family of 3D Quasi-Geostrophic System and Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equation. For conferences and publications see my [CV](files/CV.pdf). 

I also have interests in programming and time series analysis. I was a summer intern at World Quant LLC in summer 2023 and have done projects related to auto-encoder, optimization method, C++ programming and finance.
