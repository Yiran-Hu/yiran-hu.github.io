Hi, I am Yiran Hu, a Quantitative Research Analyst at Qube Research & Technology in Hong Kong. My old email address is no longer accessible. Please [email me](mailto:yr.fuhk@gmail.com) or find me on LinkedIn if you want to reach out.

I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin. During my Ph.D., my research was rooted in the theoretical and numerical analysis of partial differential equations. Specifically, I developed an interest in the 3D quasi-geostrophic system and the surface quasi-geostrophic equation. I worked under the mentorship of Professor [Alexis Vasseur](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/vasseur/). For a comprehensive overview of my academic journey, please see my [curriculum vitae](files/CV.pdf). Before pursuing my Ph.D., I graduated from Nanjing University.


Research Interests
======
I investigate the intricate discipline of Partial Differential Equations, both in theory and numerical analysis. Currently, my primary research is concentrated on the 3D Quasi-Geostrophic System and Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equation, with problems with strong physical emphases. Additionally, I’m interested in elliptic theories, particularly those involving spectrum analysis. Presently, I explore a singular or degenerated family of the 3D Quasi-Geostrophic System and the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equation. For details of my contributions to academic conferences and publications, please see my [curriculum vitae](files/CV.pdf). 

In addition to my scholarly pursuits, I’m an enthusiastic learner of programming. My dedication to academic rigor and the pursuit of knowledge extends to my practical experience, as I completed a meaningful internship at World Quant LLC during the summer of 2023. I engaged in financial research projects that encompassed auto-encoder, time series analysis, optimization methodologies, data analysis and C++ programming. Please see my [resume](files/Resume.pdf) here.
